<small> Note: These solutions are not intended to be elegant; I began solving Advent of Code problems in 2023
while taking a data structures course in undergrad. My purpose with these challenges is to maintain proficiency in
Java and to keep practicing and learning new concepts. Additionally, I did not start organizing my code into
a repository until early 2025 which had led to some interesting oddities showing up in my earlier solutions
(namely those for 2015). I have attempted to adapt my older solutions into the format laid out by this
repository, but make no promises.</small>
